# Javascript Ray Tracer!
---
This is a simple ray tracer I am making with help from Tom Macwright's tutorial on how to make as readable ray tracer in Javascript.

You can find out more here: http://www.macwright.org/literate-raytracer/

The tutorial doesn't incorporate a checkered floor like the classic Whitted example so I included a checkered floor on my own.

### Instructions:
Simply run the index.html in any HTML5 supporting browser
